## Nolan Barker

Hey there.
I'm Nolan Barker, a programmer based in Farmington Hills, MI.
I've been enjoying using computers to solve problems with code for nearly a decade now.
I lead the programming team of FRC team
[3414 (Hackbots)](https://www.fpsrobotics.com),
where I was a 2025 Dean's List Semi-Finalist!

I'm currently enrolled at North Farmington High School, class of 2026.

### Languages I use

* Rust
* Go
* Python
* Java
* C

My favorite problems to solve are those with respect to:
* control theory
* robot vision and autonomous navigation
* math-focused problems

I've (technically) made contributions to open-source libraries like WPILib, but I plan on working more on that in the future and being more involved.

Some of the fun problems I've solved with code include:
* A very fast spellchecker, built in rust
* E2EE chat server built in Go with TUI interface
* More to come!

Check out my repos for more cool projects.
